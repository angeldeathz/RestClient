# Restclient
This is a simple Library that makes REST Request to any API Rest.

# Why RestClient?
This Library uses the HttpClient dotnet class and this library abstracts the usage of HttpClient.
So, the usage is simplest.

# Compatibility
This Library is compatible with just NET 5.0, but, soon will be availible for dotnet core 3.1 and
.NET Framework.
